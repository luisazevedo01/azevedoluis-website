        <p>
          I went to an intensive bootcamp where I was taught to be an
          autodidact, with a lot left to learn, I uncovered a passion for
          blockchain. Today I am a part of a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous
          Organization) where I'm in close to the blockchain world! Since I
          began gaining valuable digital skills, I've been able to make more
          money, pursue passions that I care about, and, ultimately, enjoy
          freedom and flexibility.
