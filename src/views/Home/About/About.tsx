          My journey started when I got accepted into Academia de CÃ³digo's
          Bootcamp, where I learned the taste of code but specifically to be an
          autodidact. With a pile of energy to spare, I uncovered a passion for
          blockchain. Being part of a DAO(Decentralized Autonomous Organization)
          has increased my curiosity about blockchain while developing my
          frontend skills. Today I am looking for new projects that will
          challenge me and make me a better developer.
